Availability Estimate
Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Minimum RTO for a single region outage
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Minimum RPO for a single region outage

Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and cost are three key metrics that dictate your DR solution when developing your DR strategy.
Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) are two key metrics to consider when developing a DR plan.

RTO represents how many hours it takes you to return to a working state after a disaster.

RPO, which is also expressed in hours, represents how much data you could lose when a disaster happens. For example, an RPO of 1 hour means that you could lose up to 1 hour’s worth of data when a disaster occurs.

Amazon RDS for SQL Server provides a Multi-AZ deployment, which replicates data synchronously across Availability Zones. This is a highly available (HA) Multi-AZ deployment 
which is a solid Disaster Recovery strategy.

## Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

Replication in Multi AZ deployment is synchronous. Hence the database is updated concurrently in both primary and standby
in order to preserve the latest database updates. Therefore the RPO for single AZ outage will be approximately one minute. 

## Minimum RPO for a single region outage

In Multi-AZ, Multi-region mode, the primary database asynchronously updates the read replica database. It can take 
15-20 minutes for system to get into Available state.  Therefore the minimum RPO for single region outage is around 15 minutes.


The following table showcases the average RPO and RTO metrics you can attain with various HA and DR capabilities of Amazon RDS for SQL Server. (1)

Feature	RPO (approximate)	RTO (approximate)
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ	0	1–2 Minutes
Read replica promotion (in-Region)	Minutes	< 5 Minutes
PITR (in-Region) using automated backups	5 Minutes	Minutes–Hours
PITR (cross-Region) using automated backups	6–20 Minutes	Minutes–Hours
Snapshot restore	Hours	Minutes–Hours
